# shloball

Its a free to play game. It's like Deathball and Rocket League, a 2D multiplayer (2 players to start) game where each player is playing on the same screen. Each player is trying to get the ball in the opponent's net. The players are dogs. There are a variety of levels, with varying obstacles, but the general shape of each stage is rectangular. The gameplay is fast-pace and chaotic, but rewards a skilled player.

The game is implemented in Typescript for the browser. It uses the standard 2D HTML5 canvas.
