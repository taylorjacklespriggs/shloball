# shloball

Its a game. It's like Deathball and Rocket League, a 2D multiplayer (2 players to start) game where each player is trying to get the ball in the opponent's net. The players are dogs. There are a variety of levels, with varying obstacles, but the general shape of each stage is rectangular. The gameplay is fast-pace and chaotic, but rewards a skilled player.

The game is implemented in Typescript for the browser. It uses the standard 2D HTML5 canvas.
